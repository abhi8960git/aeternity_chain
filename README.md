## Inspiration

The inspiration behind MaxAE stems from the desire to leverage the efficiency and fairness of the Aeternity blockchain to revolutionize the DeFi landscape. The project draws inspiration from the successful PoolTogether protocol while incorporating enhancements to maximize the yield for participants and ensure a fair distribution of rewards.

By harnessing the power of Aeternity, MaxAE enables users to pool their funds and invest in carefully selected investment strategies, leveraging the advanced capabilities of the blockchain. The project aims to address several challenges faced by users and investors in traditional financial systems, such as limited access to high-yield investment opportunities and inequitable distribution of returns.

MaxAE's innovative approach provides a transparent and accessible platform for participants to pool their resources and earn maximum yield through the integration of Aeternity's efficient smart contract capabilities. The protocol introduces a random selection mechanism to determine the winner, ensuring fairness and equal opportunities for all participants. Additionally, MaxAE aims to foster loyalty and incentivize long-term participation by providing prizes based on users' commitment to the protocol.

Overall, the inspiration behind MaxAE lies in the vision of creating a decentralized and inclusive DeFi ecosystem on the Aeternity blockchain, where users can maximize their earnings, experience fairness, and benefit from the platform's flexibility and customization options.

## What it does

MaxAE is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Aeternity blockchain. The protocol enables users to pool their AE tokens, maximize yield through investments in Aeternity-based vaults, and distribute a majority percentage of the interest earned to a randomly chosen winner, while the remaining interest is proportionally distributed to other participants.

The protocol operates through the following steps:

User Deposits: Users can deposit their AE tokens into the prize pool within a specified time frame.

Prize Pool Allocation: The prize pool allocates the funds to various Aeternity-based vaults, maximizing the yield generated. Users receive tickets representing their share in the pool.

Withdrawal and Burning: After a predetermined period, the prize pool burns the tickets, withdraws the principal amount, and collects the earned interest from the Aeternity-based vaults.

Winner Selection: A random user is selected as the winner, who receives their initial principal along with a majority share of the earned interest.

Losers Distribution: The remaining participants, referred to as "losers," receive their initial principal along with a portion of the interest divided by the total tickets minted in the pool up to that point. This ensures that all participants receive a prize.

MaxAE on the Aeternity blockchain aims to address several challenges faced by users and investors in traditional financial systems. These challenges include:

Yield Maximization: By leveraging Aeternity-based vaults, the protocol allows investors to pool their AE tokens and earn maximum yield on their investments.

Fair Distribution: The protocol ensures a fair distribution of interest earnings. The winner is randomly selected, promoting equal opportunities, while the remaining interest is proportionally distributed among participants based on their contribution.

Accessibility and Transparency: MaxAE provides an open and accessible platform for anyone to participate in investment opportunities on the Aeternity blockchain. The blockchain technology ensures transparency and traceability throughout the investment process.

Customization and Flexibility: The protocol offers flexibility by allowing users to deploy custom pools with their choice of Aeternity-based vaults, prize distribution strategies, and the percentage of the award given to the winner.

With MaxAE on the Aeternity blockchain, users can pool their AE tokens, maximize yield, and participate in a fair and transparent DeFi ecosystem tailored specifically to the Aeternity blockchain.

## Challenges we ran into

Choosing a yield aggregator was an easy task, but we also wanted to introduce a new feature that went beyond the PoolTogether concept. This posed our first challenge. Initially, we contemplated developing a protocol similar to Rari-Fuse, where users could deploy customized pools and accept deposits from others. However, after extensive discussions with our mentor, we realized that this approach would undermine the fundamental purpose of pooling resources.

As a team, we brainstormed and delved into finding a solution that would prevent participants from earning zero returns after their funds had been deposited in a yield aggregator for an extended period. This became our primary challenge, and we were determined to address it effectively. Throughout the development process, we encountered various obstacles that required our collective effort to overcome.

By working together, we were able to tackle these challenges head-on and make significant progress in building the MaxAE project. Our collaborative approach and continuous learning allowed us to create a unique DeFi protocol that maximizes yield, ensures fairness, and provides a rewarding experience for all participants. We are proud of our ability to overcome obstacles and build a project that reflects our shared vision and dedication.



## What we learned

Throughout the journey of developing the MaxAE project, we learned valuable lessons that shaped our understanding of DeFi and blockchain technology. Here are some key insights we gained:

Understanding Yield Aggregators: We deepened our knowledge of yield aggregators and their role in maximizing returns on deposited funds. Exploring different platforms and protocols helped us grasp the intricacies of yield optimization strategies.

Designing Incentive Mechanisms: We discovered the importance of creating fair and rewarding incentive mechanisms within DeFi protocols. Our focus on ensuring that no participant goes profitless taught us the significance of balancing incentives for both winners and losers.

Smart Contract Development: Building the project in Sophia, the smart contract language of the Aeternity blockchain, enhanced our proficiency in writing secure and efficient code. We gained insights into contract deployment, interaction, and testing on the Aeternity network.

Collaborative Problem-Solving: We realized the power of collaboration and teamwork in overcoming challenges. By actively engaging in discussions, sharing ideas, and leveraging each team member's strengths, we found innovative solutions to complex problems.

Adapting to Feedback: Receiving guidance and feedback from our mentor and the community allowed us to refine our ideas and approach. We learned the importance of being open to feedback, iterating on our designs, and continuously improving the project.

Balancing Innovation and Practicality: We learned the delicate balance between introducing new features and maintaining the practicality of the project. We had to evaluate the feasibility and impact of each idea to ensure a well-rounded and user-friendly solution
